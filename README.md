# Codelitt-Backend
## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create a backend using Node using a GraphQL arquitecture.

### The Task

In this task, we are building backend of an application that helps us in managing our team using GraphQL.

### Features and Requirements
- A member has a name and a type the late one can be an employee or a contractor.
- - If it's a contractor, we want to store the the duration of the contract as an integer.
- - If it's an employee, we need to store their role, for instance: Software Engineer, Project Manager and so on.
- A member can be tagged, for instance: C#, Angular, General Frontend, Seasoned Leader and so on. (Tags will likely be used as filters later, so keep that in mind)
- We need to offer GraphQL CRUD for all the information above.
